## Summary

We conducted several tests of the Loomo camera hardware to try and capture images of people suitable for face recognition. In the end, we found the hardware insufficient in exposure range, capture speed, and resolution.

## Environment

The [National Optical Astronomy Observatory](https://www.noao.edu/) provide a [recommended light levels](https://www.noao.edu/education/QLTkit/ACTIVITY_Documents/Safety/LightLevels_outdoor+indoor.pdf) resource for instructors. Pertinent to our example in this section of one of the tables.

| Activity | Illumination (lux) |
|-|-|
| Working areas where visual tasks are only occasionally performed | 100-150 |
| Warehouses, Homes, Theaters, Archives | 150 |
| Easy Office Work, Classes | 250 |

We tested the Loomo in three locations, 2 well trafficked hallways (103 lux & 214 lux) and by a west facing window in the afternoon sun (2157 lux). So these are not non-standard low light conditions.

## Day 1

Images were recorded at maximum resolution of 3264x2448
, most images captured were too blurry for the model to detect any faces.

There were a few images where faces could be detected

## Day 2 & 3

Images were recorded at maximum resolution of 3264x2448

## Day 4

Images were recorded at maximum resolution of 3264x2448

## Day 5-1

Images were recorded at maximum resolution of 640x480

## Day 5-2

Images were recorded at maximum resolution of 1920x1080
